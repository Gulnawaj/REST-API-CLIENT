# REST-API-CLIENT

#DESCRIPTION

In this project, I made a simple Java program that connects to a public REST API and shows the result in a clean format. The program uses the Agify API, which predicts a personâ€™s age by their name.
I used HttpURLConnection and URI classes to send an HTTP GET request to the API. The API sends data in JSON format, and instead of using any extra library, I parsed the JSON manually using basic indexOf and substring methods.
